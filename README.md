# A-B-Test
A/B test for udacity course introduction page

The goal is to analyze one of Udacity’s A/B Tests — whether or not a friendly message letting new users know that success in Udacity courses takes 5+ hours per week will deter some unprepared students (and therefore less likely to succeed) from consuming coaching resources while at the same time not diminishing the rate of students that sign up for the course and finish successfully.
